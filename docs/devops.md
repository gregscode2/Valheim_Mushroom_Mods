# DevOps

How the mods get built and published, and how to check the pipeline still works
before you rely on it.

Everything here is handled by
[`.github/workflows/release.yml`](../.github/workflows/release.yml), a single
workflow named **Build mod DLLs**.

## Smoke test

The pipeline has one throwaway **draft** release, `ci-test`, that exists purely
to be re-uploaded to. Run this after touching the workflow, adding a mod, or
changing how any mod resolves its references:

```bash
gh workflow run "Build mod DLLs" --ref main -f release_tag=ci-test
```

It builds every mod and attaches the DLLs to that draft, exercising the exact
path a real release takes — including `gh release upload`, which is otherwise
only reached when a release is published. The upload uses `--clobber`, so the
same draft can be reused indefinitely.

Check the result:

```bash
gh run watch $(gh run list --workflow="Build mod DLLs" --limit 1 --json databaseId -q '.[0].databaseId')
```

```bash
gh release view ci-test
```

A draft release creates **no git tag** and is invisible to anyone browsing the
repo, so this costs nothing and pollutes nothing. If `ci-test` is ever deleted,
recreate it with:

```bash
gh release create ci-test --draft --title "CI smoke test" --notes "Not a real release."
```

To build without touching any release at all — useful when you only care that
the mods compile — dispatch with `release_tag` left blank. The DLLs come out as
a normal Actions artifact and the upload step is skipped:

```bash
gh workflow run "Build mod DLLs" --ref main
```

## Cutting a real release

Publishing a GitHub release fires the workflow on `release: [published]` and
attaches every mod's DLL to it. No built DLL is committed to the repo, so a
downloaded plugin always corresponds to a tagged commit.

## How CI gets the game assemblies

The mods reference Valheim and BepInEx assemblies, which cannot be committed.
The runner therefore fetches its own:

- **Game assemblies** come from the **Valheim Dedicated Server** (Steam app
  `896660`), which is free and available to an anonymous `steamcmd` login. It
  ships the same managed assemblies the client does.
- **BepInEx** comes from the Thunderstore API for `denikson/BepInExPack_Valheim`,
  resolved at run time rather than pinned, so it tracks the current release.

Both are assembled into a **synthetic client install layout** under
`ci-refs/valheim-root/`:

```
ci-refs/valheim-root/
├── valheim_Data/Managed/    <- from the dedicated server
└── BepInEx/core/            <- from Thunderstore
```

The layout matters. Each mod invented its own name for the reference root, so
the workflow passes *every* spelling as an MSBuild global property, all pointing
at that one tree:

| Property | Used by |
|---|---|
| `ValheimManaged`, `BepInExCore` | vegvisir-compass, RandomYggdrasil, SeparateSpawns |
| `ValheimDir` | CombatAdjustments, haldor-expansion |
| `GamePath` | CraftableSpawners |

Global properties beat anything a project sets itself, which is what overrides
the hardcoded local install paths (`F:\Steam\...`, Steam-registry lookups) that
resolve to nothing on a runner.

The whole tree is cached. Bump `REFS_CACHE_VERSION` in the workflow to discard
it and refetch — worth doing after a Valheim update the mods need to build
against. A cold run takes roughly two minutes; a cached one about half that.

## Adding a mod

Discovery is generic: every top-level directory is scanned for `.csproj`, so a
new mod directory needs no workflow change. It does need two things:

1. **Resolve its references through one of the property names above.** Give the
   property a local default so a bare `dotnet build` still works — the pattern
   used by most of the mods here consults the Steam registry first:

   ```xml
   <ValheimDir Condition="'$(ValheimDir)' == ''">$([MSBuild]::GetRegistryValueFromView('HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\Steam App 892970', 'InstallLocation', null, RegistryView.Registry64, RegistryView.Registry32))</ValheimDir>
   ```

2. **Add any new reference to the verify step's list.** The workflow checks the
   union of every assembly the mods need before building, so a missing one
   produces a named failure instead of a wall of `CS0246`.

Projects under `bin/`, `obj/`, `tools/` and `Decompiled/` are skipped — they are
build output, dev tooling, and decompiled game source respectively, none of them
shippable. Two projects emitting the same assembly name fail the build rather
than silently overwriting each other in the artifact folder.

## Building locally

Most mods build with no arguments, resolving the game path from the Steam
registry:

```bash
dotnet build -c Release
```

Two do not, and need the install passed explicitly:

- **CombatAdustments** defaults `ValheimDir` to `F:\Steam\steamapps\common\Valheim`.
- **haldor-expansion** errors unless you create `Local.props` from
  `Local.props.example`.

```bash
dotnet build haldor-expansion/HaldorExpansion.csproj -c Release -p:ValheimDir="C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Valheim"
```

vegvisir-compass reads its path from `Directory.Build.user.props`, which is
gitignored — see its own README.

## Things that look broken but are not

**`steamcmd attempt 1 produced no managed assemblies; retrying.`** — expected.
steamcmd exits `7` on its own self-update pass having downloaded nothing, so the
workflow judges success by whether the assemblies actually appeared and retries
once. Attempt 2 succeeds.

**`Download Valheim managed assemblies` / `Download BepInEx core` skipped** —
a cache hit. The reference tree was restored instead of refetched.

**`Attach DLLs to the release` skipped** — the run was a dispatch with no
`release_tag`. Only a published release or an explicit tag triggers the upload.

## Never commit

- Game assemblies (`assembly_*.dll`, `UnityEngine*.dll`) and BepInEx
  (`BepInEx*.dll`, `0Harmony*.dll`). Reference them from the local install; CI
  fetches its own.
- Decompiled game source. Keep it locally for looking up method names if you
  like — `Decompiled/` is gitignored.
- Build output. Releases carry the artifacts.
